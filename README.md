# regexes
A collection of my best/most impressive/most useful regexes

## Contributing
### Contributing explanations of regexes
If you want to contribute explanations to any of these regexes, feel free to send a pull request. Add these at the bottom of the file - most of the time, people (including me), won't be intreseted in how/why the regex works (people will just care that it does work).

### Contributing new regexes
If you want to contribute a new regex, just send a PR that adds a new file in the appropriate directory describing the regex (try to follow the structure of the other `.regex.md` files)
